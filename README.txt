Everthing is in working order.

A few things, to end the game I tried
to use the line of code 'exit();'. This 
ended up throwing an error into the console,
but for all intents and purposes ends the game.

I added a few things:

Accuracy - Your accuracy (squishes / clicks)
is displayed at the end of the game.

Early ending - If you click every bug, the 
game will end before the time runs out. If 
you do not click all the bugs, the game will
end when the time runs out.
